Problem Set No 2

Problem 2.1 – General Concepts in Group Theory (3 points)

(a) A subgroup is a subset of a group that is “closed” under the group operations. Show
that H is a subgroup of G if and only if for all h1 , h2 À H, we have h*1
h2 À H.

(b) The multiplication table of a group lists the products one may form from all
pairs g1 , g2 of group elements. Imagine you have a group with nine elements, and you
label them “1”, “2” . . . “9”. Obviously, each line of the multiplication table is then a
permutation of the nine elements (Cayley theorem). For each column, this is also true,
although column no. 3 and line no. 3 will in general differ (non-commutative group).
This looks like the properties of a Sudoku puzzle. Find out why most of the Sudokus
do not give a proper multiplication table. Find a group with nine elements and check
whether its table is a proper Sudoku.
(c) The “character” of an element in a matrix group is defined by the trace of its
matrix,
(2.1)

(g) = tr M(g)

It is invariant under a basis change (aka similarity transformation) where M(g) ;ô
M ® (g) = S *1 M(g) S. Show that for rotation matrices in 3D, the character only depends
on the rotation angle, but not on the axis of rotation.
Problem 2.2 – Discrete Groups and Characters (1 point)

Consider the symmetry group of a two-dimensional square and of the
three-dimensional tetrahedron. (You can list the corners of a tetrahedron as
{(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (1, 1, 1)}.) Compute the character of a few symmetry
elements and comment.
Problem 2.3 – Subgroups and boosts (3 points)
